# Fake-Or-Fact

Welcome!!! Fake or Fact is an android Trivia app designed to put your obscure knowledge to the test! Play by yourself and do your best to determine if the statement shown to you is fact or fact. Or you can play against your friends to see who knows more. Good luck and have fun!

# Quiz Yourself

When you select the quiz yourself option you can test your knowledge in 4 different categories:
* History
* Science
* Art
* Random

All of these categories are fairly self explanatory except for random. The random category will present random statements that don't belong to any of the previous categories such as a newspaper headline. Each category will tell you something that is either completely made up, or happens to be a not well known fact. Upon selecting a category and starting the game the quiz will begin. You have 20 seconds to answer the question. If you get it right you'll earn points, get it wrong and you'll lose some. After 20 questions have been completed the game will end and will tell you your final score. The game will remember each time you play a category and tell you whether or not your score has improved since the last time.
